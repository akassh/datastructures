1. Given the root node of a binary tree, return the number of elements in the
binary tree. Look at count.c for a sample solution.

2. Given the root node of a binary tree, return the height of the tree binary
tree. Height of an empty tree/subtree is 0 and height of a node with only a
root node is 1. Loot at height.c for a sample solution.

3. Given the root node of a binary tree, find if the tree satisfies binary search
tree properties.

4. Given the root node of a binary tree, find the mirror of the binary tree.
In the mirrored tree, all subtrees at their root have left and right subtree
swapped.
